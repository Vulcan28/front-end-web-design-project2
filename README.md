Aim: Use a front-end framework to create an experimental responsive website.

I started with the base structure provided to us by Ben and first experimented by editing the .md file to add ideas I had for the website. I originally added some ideas so I could brainstorm what I wanted to do the website on, the ideas I came up with where,
•	A Portfolio
•	An advertisement of a job
•	An info page on a historical site
•	An info page on a game
•	A Instructions page 
I quickly decided to do a page on a historical site as it would let me pull information from a prebuilt website and was more formal and interesting to me than most of the other options, the other option I mainly considered was to do a portfolio of on myself, I disregarded this option largely due to the amount of time it would take me to create a personal portfolio and add all of my information to it as I had never done it before and would have to start from scratch.

After I decided to do an informational page on a historical site I had to decide what site to document, I felt inspired by ANZAC day and the dawn service to make a site on the Australian war Memorial so I started to look at the website and search for information I might use, I eventually found most of my information at https://www.awm.gov.au/about/organisation/history, I took most of my information from this website to add to mine.

The first thing I did was add the core text to the .md file to add it to my site, I then tried to figure out how to add images and how to grid my information on my website and after failing to figure this out I gave up and started trying to add separate posts that could be linked to the main page using 11ty, I failed to get this working after trying for an extended period of time and decided that my website would be better without it. I then went back to trying to add imaged to my website, I found three ways of doing this, on through the .md file, another through the CSS by applying it as a background to a div, and the traditional way through a html command in the homepage.html. I initially added all of my images through the .md file but I quickly switched to doing it through the html so I could use CSS on the easily. I also started to split up my content into different divs using the hompage.html layout and by linking it into my .md file so the word content would be pulled from there, this allowed me to organize my page and add more styles to it with CSS.

After adding all of my content I started to work on the css, I initially started my modifying the final css file only to have my work disappear every time I changed something in my .md file causing me problems, I eventually caught on the to fact I was modifying the wrong file and corrected my mistake albite after about an hour of work. I then started by adding a basic grid system to organize my content on my page, the most notable change this made was putting the founders side by side and tidying up most of my content, most of the additions from this point on where either minor cleanups or additions such as the addition of an image gallery at the bottom of the page. The final change that was made to the site was the addition of a media query and the automatic resizing of images in order the make the site responsive allowing the site to be displayed on any device.

The main aspect I struggled with in this assignment was not editing the final.html and css file directly to achieve my goals as this seemed like the easier option most of the time, however after having used the front end framework for some time now I found it to be useful and interesting and I would use to build a website again. If I had more time to work on my page I would have added more beautifying elements and more information to my webpage to make it more expansive and informative.
